Contains 1 program (``narcissistic_number.py``)

A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base.

The ``narcissistic_number.py`` program asks for a number then decides if its True or False.

The program stops, after the print-out.
